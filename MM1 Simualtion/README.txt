PROJECT : M/M/1 Queuing Simulation

To run this simulation. One should open "QueuingSim" project and run it.
After run, program will give some simulation results such as arrival rate, service rate, mean queue length etc. 100000 jobs are simulated using exponentially distributed random interarrival tmes and service times.
